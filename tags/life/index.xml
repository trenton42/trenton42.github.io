      <description>In this holiday season (and pretty much any other time, now) it is nearly impossible to avoid the bombardment of advertisements. Maybe i&amp;rsquo;ve been growing cynical, but i have become a lot more antagonistic toward companies that advertise in ways i don&amp;rsquo;t like. So here is the handy guide i use to interpret ads.
 Sign says: &amp;ldquo;Deals starting at just $20!&amp;rdquo;
i read: &amp;ldquo;Absolutely nothing under $20&amp;rdquo;
 Sign says: &amp;ldquo;Save at up to $10!</description>

      <description>Black Friday means something quite different to me. See, three years ago on Black Friday, i was mugged. Not a &amp;ldquo;Hey you, give me your wallet&amp;rdquo; kind of mugging, but more of the &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll just smash your face and not ask&amp;rdquo; kind. i woke up in the hospital without any memory of what happened (in fact, i lost several hours worth of memories). i went through two surgeries, and had my jaw wired shut for a couple of months, but it could have been a lot worse &amp;ndash; especially for my family.</description>
