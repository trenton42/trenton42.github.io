      <description>The recent Kubernetes vulnerability CVE-2018-1002105 should be a wake up call to any organization that is running Kubernetes, but does not have a regular update strategy in place. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail about the vulnerability as that is well documented in many places, but what I want to focus on is the challenge of keeping your cluster up to date.
Keeping up with Kubernetes releases can certainly be challenging as it is a fairly fast moving project, and it is also somewhat complex to deploy especially on bare metal.</description>
