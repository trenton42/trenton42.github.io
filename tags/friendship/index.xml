      <description>It started with a song It was a chance sound. The simple humming of a couple of bars of a song triggered by something else in the conversation, but that is all it takes sometimes. Suddenly I was standing in Toronto around 1997 hearing that same song and seeing the person that would be forever connected to it. I feel fortunate that the only way I can see your face is always in mid laugh.</description>
