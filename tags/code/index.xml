      <description>After forgetting about this for, hmm, three years, I figured it was time to start writing again. And of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t just write. I also have to start over with everything. So this time around I am using Hugo for my static site engine.
I enjoy using Hugo as it has some nice tricks up its sleeve while being quite easy to get running.
Recently, I have also been using VSCode, and to make it a little easier to generate posts I use the following launch.</description>

      <title>Attaching StringIO Data to a Mailgun Message</title>

      <description>Recently i started using Mailgun for our outgoing messages. They have a very nice API, and take a lot of the heavy lifting out of creating multipart messages.
If you are using requests (or treq) to send the messages through their REST API, however, you may have noticed that you must specify &amp;ldquo;attachment&amp;rdquo; as the key, and an open file handle as the value. This works great if you are sending files from the filesystem, but if you need to send generated or in memory data as a file attachment, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>i was playing around with some imaging code, and started wondering what it would look like to create some images out of text. i have worked with stenography in the past, but this time i didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hide the text, i wanted to pack the image with it.
First things first, i need some text. Time to turn to trusty Project Gutenberg. i will be using the text of Moby Dick for this project.</description>

      <description>I whipped up this theme for liquidluck recently. It is based on Bootstrap 3, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain many bells or whistles (as you can see).
Clone it here https://github.com/trenton42/liquidluck-theme-bootstrap3
i will (hopefully) be working on some improvements in the future.</description>
