            <![CDATA[ <p>Black Friday means something quite different to me. See, three years ago on Black Friday, i was mugged. Not a &ldquo;Hey you, give me your wallet&rdquo; kind of mugging, but more of the &ldquo;We&#39;ll just smash your face and not ask&rdquo; kind. i woke up in the hospital without any memory of what happened (in fact, i lost several hours worth of memories). i went through two surgeries, and had my jaw wired shut for a couple of months, but it could have been a lot worse &ndash; especially for my family.</p>
<p>It took a smash to the face to help me realize how much i have to be thankful for, and how much the things i do affect those around me. i certainly hope that it won&#39;t take something so drastic to do the same for you.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>I whipped up this theme for <a href="https://github.com/lepture/liquidluck">liquidluck</a> recently. It is based on Bootstrap 3, and doesn&#39;t contain many bells or whistles (as you can see).</p>
<p>Clone it here <a href="https://github.com/trenton42/liquidluck-theme-bootstrap3">https://github.com/trenton42/liquidluck-theme-bootstrap3</a></p>
<p>i will (hopefully) be working on some improvements in the future.</p>

            <![CDATA[ <p>Just finished a little work with <a href="https://github.com/lepture/liquidluck">liquidluck</a>. i hadn&#39;t heard of it before, but <a href="http://zigg.com">zigg</a> mentioned it, so i thought i would give it a try. Honestly, i wasn&#39;t really sure about yet another static site generator, but so far i am impressed. Now if only i can keep writing things down.</p>
<p>i will also hopefully get the template i made for it packaged up. i&#39;m not completely satisfied with it, but it will keep me going for the time being. But for now, it&#39;s time to sleep.</p>
