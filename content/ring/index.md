## Newsletters

I love these newsletters as they are very personal, informative, and just human. This is content from one person to another without an algorithm deciding what you should or should not see.

* Dan Hon - [Things That Caught My Attention](https://newsletter.danhon.com/)
* Cassidy Williams - [rendezvous with cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) a tech newsletter for you
* Sam Matla - [Weekly insights](https://sammatla.com/blog/) on how to increase your output, make better decisions, and get more done in less time

* [マリウス.com](https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/) - A personal site with so many interesting things: from travel to photography to keyboards to code (and yes, the domain name is real and legit -- learn about [Punycode](https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/never-click-on-a-link-that-looks-like-that/) on the same site).
* [James Stanley](https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/) - Well written and interesting stories (tag line from his website: _The writing is bad and the stories are not very interesting._). Check out James' projects 😮👏
* [Dave Jacoby](https://jacoby.github.io/) - When you need a dose of Perl
