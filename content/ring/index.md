## People I find interesting

* Dan Hon - [Things That Caught My Attention](https://newsletter.danhon.com/) 📩
* Cassidy Williams - [rendezvous with cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) a tech newsletter for you 📩
* Sam Matla - [Weekly insights](https://sammatla.com/) on how to increase your output, make better decisions, and get more done in less time 📩
* [マリウス.com](https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/) - A personal site with so many interesting things: from travel to photography to keyboards to code (and yes, the domain name is real and legit -- learn about [Punycode](https://xn--gckvb8fzb.com/never-click-on-a-link-that-looks-like-that/) on the same site).
* [James Stanley](https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/) - Well written and interesting stories (tag line from his website: _The writing is bad and the stories are not very interesting._). Check out James' projects 😮👏
