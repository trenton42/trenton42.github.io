<canvas id="world" style="width: 100%;">

{{<script "scripts/world.js">}}

I started to work with the canvas again. I love those old 2d RPGs, and I also had a programming itch to scratch.

So far, there is not much to see. You can only walk around a baren wasteland (and the camera does not yet follow you around). The character artwork is from OpenGameArt.org by the user [Antifarea][1]
