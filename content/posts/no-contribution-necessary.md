I saw the <i><b>Dinner With Barack</b></i> <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/dinner-with-barack" target="_blank">contest</a> today, and thought I would take a look at it. At first, it looked like the only way to enter was to make a campaign contribution, but that did not sound right. I looked a little more closely and saw that there was a link to enter without donating.<br /> <br /> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody> <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7UGVegjFwSs/T1Bu8wDTHrI/AAAAAAAAR0g/eLF-dDPC3yk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-03-01+at+5.43.15+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="385" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7UGVegjFwSs/T1Bu8wDTHrI/AAAAAAAAR0g/eLF-dDPC3yk/s640/Screen+Shot+2012-03-01+at+5.43.15+PM.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr> <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Highlighted: <span style="background-color: yellow;">Contributing will not improve chances of winning.</span></td></tr> </tbody></table> <br /> So I signed up! After doing so, I got the following email:<br /> <br /> <blockquote style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px;"> <div class="p1"> You've signed up for a chance to win a seat at dinner with President Obama. Thanks for entering.</div> <div class="p2"> <br /></div> <div class="p1"> So, what's your story? Take 30 seconds to tell us why you're supporting the President in 2012:</div> <div class="p2"> <br /></div> <div class="p3"> <span class="s1"><a href="http://my.barackobama.com/share-your-story-dwb-auto">http://my.barackobama.com/share-your-story-dwb-auto</a></span></div> <div class="p2"> <br /></div> <div class="p1"> If you'd like, <span style="background-color: yellow;">you can improve your odds by making a donation today</span>. Each donation from now until March 31st, 2012, at 11:59 p.m. counts as another entry to win. Donate here:</div> <div class="p2"> <br /></div> <div class="p3"> <span class="s1"><a href="http://my.barackobama.com/enter-again-auto">http://my.barackobama.com/enter-again-auto</a></span></div> <div class="p2"> <br /></div> <div class="p1"> We've always depended on supporters like you -- not Washington lobbyists or special interests -- for every dollar we get. Your support will help pay for new offices, organizer trainings, and resources like phones and clipboards to support our hard-working staff and volunteers.</div> <div class="p2"> <br /></div> <div class="p1"> Thanks again,</div> <div class="p2"> <br /></div> <div class="p1"> Obama for America</div> </blockquote> I'm not sure if I am just being overly sensitive, but those statements seem to be saying completely opposite things. Any thoughts?<br />
