description: Thankfulness through face smashing

---

Black Friday means something quite different to me. See, three years ago on Black Friday, i was mugged. Not a "Hey you, give me your wallet" kind of mugging, but more of the "We'll just smash your face and not ask" kind. i woke up in the hospital without any memory of what happened (in fact, i lost several hours worth of memories). i went through two surgeries, and had my jaw wired shut for a couple of months, but it could have been a lot worse -- especially for my family.

It took a smash to the face to help me realize how much i have to be thankful for, and how much the things i do affect those around me. i certainly hope that it won't take something so drastic to do the same for you.
