description: On how I ported my blog to liquidluck
draft: false
---

Just finished a little work with [liquidluck](https://github.com/lepture/liquidluck). i hadn't heard of it before, but [zigg](http://zigg.com) mentioned it, so i thought i would give it a try. Honestly, i wasn't really sure about yet another static site generator, but so far i am impressed. Now if only i can keep writing things down.

i will also hopefully get the template i made for it packaged up. i'm not completely satisfied with it, but it will keep me going for the time being. But for now, it's time to sleep.
