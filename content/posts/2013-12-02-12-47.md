description: Ads are everywhere! What do they all mean?

---

In this holiday season (and pretty much any other time, now) it is nearly impossible to avoid the bombardment of advertisements. Maybe i've been growing cynical, but i have become a lot more antagonistic toward companies that advertise in ways i don't like. So here is the handy guide i use to interpret ads.

1. Sign says: "Deals starting at just $20!"

    i read: "Absolutely nothing under $20"
2. Sign says: "Save at up to $10!"

    i read: "You cannot save more than $10"
3. Sign says: "Buy one get one half off"

    i read: "Spend 50% more than you were planning"
4. Product has a celebrity endorsement

    We could not sell this product without bribing someone rich and famous to say it's good.
5. Sign says: "Make your holiday complete..."

    i read: "You will be complete... until we release the next version"

Obviously there are a lot more of these, and i will add more as i think of them. In the mean time, happy holidays!
