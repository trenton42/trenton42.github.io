<h1> Wait, Blogging Needs Words?</h1> So I had this plan to become a famous blogger. I could really see it: Blog posts everyday! Amazing information! So I did what I needed to do. I sat down and started writing. Here is what I came up with:<br /> <br /> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody> <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fdT7pSvgjI4/TyYYp5tXA9I/AAAAAAAARM8/XbSUnPrhPzU/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-01-29+at+11.11.43+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="280" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fdT7pSvgjI4/TyYYp5tXA9I/AAAAAAAARM8/XbSUnPrhPzU/s320/Screen+Shot+2012-01-29+at+11.11.43+PM.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr> <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Some of my greatest work</td></tr> </tbody></table> Ok, I was not prepared for this. I actually have to write stuff? I need ideas? Maybe I should have seen this coming.<br /> <h2> Finally, an idea!</h2> I don't have my own ideas, and I'm not so good a writing, so I'm going to need some help. Clearly, I need a ghost writer. I understand they won't be <i>completely free,</i>&nbsp;so I thought I should have a look. After searching around (i.e., clicking on the first result that had a price), I found&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/8DiXC" target="_blank">Anthony F. Shaker, PhD</a>.<br /> <br /> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody> <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DM1BF_V1zg8/TyYggtI-pjI/AAAAAAAARNE/FfvCoEr4_iU/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-01-29+at+11.38.56+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="17" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DM1BF_V1zg8/TyYggtI-pjI/AAAAAAAARNE/FfvCoEr4_iU/s320/Screen+Shot+2012-01-29+at+11.38.56+PM.png" width="320" /></a></td></tr> <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Back to the drawing board.</td></tr> </tbody></table> But wait a minute, I am using a very sophisticated piece of modern technology right now to write this post. Obviously, I should put it to work! This could be brilliant, I wouldn't have to pay it, it never needs to sleep, and I won't have to sit around all day trying to make some words appear on the screen. All I need to do is find some inspiration for my machine. How about some Mark Twain?<br /> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">The reward's bogus (maybe not: the water in England, after all). &nbsp;We'd a signal, and I wanted the river, again: and he can raise the&nbsp;time. &nbsp;Then the whole town: for Jim was no one, too, so I passed another idea.&nbsp; This long, as I reckoned he'd&nbsp;say I knowed the turnip barrel gun.</span></blockquote> Now we are getting somewhere! That is already an improvement over my writing! I just need to figure out what a turnip barrel gun is.<br /> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody> <tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/huck-raising-a-howl.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/huck-raising-a-howl.jpg" width="254" /></a></td></tr> <tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">First result for turnip barrel gun.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <br /> Now it is time to turn things up a notch. I will try to feed my machine some Joseph Conrad.<br /> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Her, to perish speedily, might have been turned out for it was&nbsp;blurred as trenchant though her body. After looking on the devil, he snored&nbsp;very far with severe exaltation; enough to brag on earth. I began again: not to himself, adored, I felt I&nbsp;climbed the most merciless of logic for a tragic end, and all other. How they wandered here, no abilities;&nbsp;and a number of board: with ink stains on it,&nbsp;deadly, eaten by the great&nbsp;thoughts, the heartache which, as I looked pretty well, was grave and profound.&nbsp;A deuce of his speeches like a stone even apart had been poisoned, but not&nbsp;both.</span></blockquote> That certainly seems more profound! I am going to have to consider that passage. &nbsp;While I do that, I will keep my machine busy, and feed it inspiration from one last author (admittedly, one of my favorites): P.G. Wodehouse.<br /> <br /> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Put the same blighter into the good, sir. &nbsp;Good style,&nbsp;and he had the will I wanted. To some equally brainy&nbsp;stranger, just to roll in as ugly as a crack under the&nbsp;situation is obliged to have put it to rest. A Rest in&nbsp;new York, by my child. &nbsp;It's off. &nbsp;And it got the&nbsp;country.&nbsp;It has taken a deuced brainy scheme to frontier it into another. That, and&nbsp;that I got through, you know.</span></blockquote> There you have it! Why stop at blogging? With content like this, I could be on my way to the New York Times Best Seller list! Of course, I have to try one more thing. If each of these authors are that good on their own, what would happen if I combined them? What if we had Joseph P.G. Twain?<br /> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Corky (trickled into the man who can't Hear Caruso; puffed a holt). &nbsp;I took&nbsp;it a mile, but at the very start was looking at all that had left. &nbsp;Now, but at the&nbsp;edge of us, ragtime on that there any man! &nbsp;Poor dear old town: for a&nbsp;worked up a learnt you know. &nbsp;I was worried and, oh frogs! Why gather from one&nbsp;or maybe, I said, what from the kitchen? It was with him since half a great time,&nbsp;and then he was on lection day.</span></blockquote> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">He's in another flash of your "I don't care nothing to it" off of mine.&nbsp;</span></blockquote> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">You're a sudden screech and thinking just then, I made notes and you didn't.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Thar be a dead man! Say, he got&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">clean till he took me out of the old Marshall.</span></blockquote> I'm speechless! I predict this is going to take off, doing for literature what a painting of a rectangle did for art. Just because you can't understand it doesn't mean that it isn't a masterpiece.<br /> <br /> One last word before I sign off:<br /> <br /> <blockquote class="tr_bq"> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Better things enough for a mind than letting it begin and take them, at first&nbsp;jolt.</span></blockquote> <br /> &nbsp;Indeed.<br /> <br /> <br />
