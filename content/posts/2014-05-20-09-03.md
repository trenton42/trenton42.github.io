description: Create a simple website client with Automator

---

I am a big fan of the [xkcd][1] comics, and was toying with different ways to view the current comic directly. At one point, I built a complicated flow to put the current comic on my desktop using [Geek Tool][2], but I wanted something I could just open periodically. Finally, I decided to give Automator a try. Turns out, it's incredibly simple.

Here is my final flow:

![Automator Final][flow]

Simple enough! You can find those two actions under the Internet section in the Library:

![Actions][actions]

Just drag the first action to the workspace, followed by the second action. Add the URL to the Get Specified URLs action (in this case I chose m.xkcd.com), and fiddle with the size options in the Website Popup action to get a size that works.

Finally, save this work flow as an application, and you are all set!
