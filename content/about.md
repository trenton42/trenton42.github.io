Hi, my name is Trenton. I am an explorer seeking to understand the world around me. I write code, manage servers, and automate the mundane to allow people the time to let their creativity shine.

I love to read -- especially in cozy coffee shops, and I love walking down a road I have never travelled. Most of all, I enjoy the time I am able to spend with my family.
