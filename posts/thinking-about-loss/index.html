  <h1>Thinking about loss</h1>

  <a class="post-tag" href='/tags/friendship'>friendship</a> <h1 id="it-started-with-a-song">It started with a song</h1>
<p>It was a chance sound. The simple humming of a couple of bars of a song triggered by something else in the conversation, but that is all it takes sometimes. Suddenly I was standing in Toronto around 1997 hearing that same song and seeing the person that would be forever connected to it. I feel fortunate that the only way I can see your face is always in mid laugh. Yes, I feel fortunate, but also guilty, because I was only there for the good times, and I only heard the laughter. By the time I found out where life had taken you, what rejection had done to you, and where the drugs and abuse left you, it was too late. I will keep your youth and your laughter. I won&rsquo;t lose those even if you have.</p>
<h2 id="the-song-carried-on">The song carried on</h2>
<p>One thing leads to another, and now I&rsquo;m putting together a playlist. It&rsquo;s another lifetime, and another you. You are different - you weren&rsquo;t supposed to be here, but that&rsquo;s a good thing. They said you would never make it. They said you wouldn&rsquo;t even live long enough for me to meet you, but here we are, listening to the playlist I have put together from a generation neither one of us are from. Every song is an inside joke, and no one else knows what we are talking about.</p>
<p>I was there for the good times, but so were you. I saw you walk once, but now I know you are dancing.</p>
<h2 id="those-dont-go-together-and-you-know-it">Those don&rsquo;t go together, and you know it</h2>
<p>Of course you wait for me to come in before you pour the coca-cola into your coffee. It&rsquo;s that grin that gives it away. It&rsquo;s the same grin you give me when you ask which plate of food tastes better even though we have both just been served from the same pot. I want to think that&rsquo;s what kept you going. You never seem to stop. I can&rsquo;t keep up because you switch languages every couple of sentences. The last one I don&rsquo;t speak, but I somehow know what you are saying.</p>
<p>Standing in that room now, I want to shout that we don&rsquo;t have much time, but I can&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t stay still and neither can I. When the words finally come out, they come back an empty, lonely echo.</p>
<p>The music has stopped, and I can&rsquo;t bear to turn it back on.</p>
